# Answer Components

This is a demo of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), React and [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org).

## Requirements

- Nodejs 14+
- VSCode

## VSCode Plugins

I've added the Tailwind CSS plugin to the `.vscode/extensions.json`, VSCode should automatically recommend them to you.

## Before Running Storybook/Tests

You will need to restore the dependencies, you could do that by running:

```bash
# if using yarn
yarn


# or if using npm
npm i
```

## Running Storybook

# if using yarn
yarn storybook


# or if using npm
npm run storybook
```
