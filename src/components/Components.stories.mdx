# Answer Digital Components

This project is a collection of components that demonstrates how one would use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

## Page Layout

Page content should be wrapped in a `Wrapper` component wherever possible. This allows the content to be centered and will provide gutters on the left and right sides.

<Canvas>
  <div>
    <section className="bg-gray-100 py-10">
      <Wrapper>
        <PrimaryPageText className="pb-2" text="This is inside a Wrapper." />
      </Wrapper>
    </section>
    <p className="py-5">This one is not.</p>
  </div>
</Canvas>

## Page Header

Typical pages will have the one `PrimaryPageText` and could have one or more `SecondaryPageText`.

<Canvas>
  <PrimaryPageText className="pb-6" text="Rendered as a h1 tag." />
  <SecondaryPageText text="This will be rendered as a h2 tag. You can have a few of these." />
</Canvas>
